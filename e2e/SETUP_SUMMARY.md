## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Page Object Model (POM)
- **Separation of Concerns**: Test logic separated from page interactions
- **Reusability**: Page objects shared across multiple tests
- **Maintainability**: UI changes only affect page objects, not tests

### 2. Test Fixtures
- **Automatic Setup**: Page objects automatically initialized for each test
- **Clean Tests**: Tests are concise and focused on business logic
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### 3. Automated Server/Client Management
- **Auto-Start**: Both server and client automatically start before tests
- **Port Management**: Server on 2567, client on 3000
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Everything cleaned up after tests complete

### 4. Best Practices Implementation
- **Semantic Locators**: Using `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`
- **Auto-Waiting**: Leveraging Playwright's built-in waiting mechanisms
- **Screenshot on Failure**: Automatic screenshot capture for debugging
- **Trace Recording**: Traces captured on first retry for debugging

## 📝 Test Coverage

### Current Tests (5 Tests in lobby.spec.ts)
1. ✅ **should load the front page successfully**
   - Navigates to lobby
   - Verifies page loads
   - Takes screenshot

2. ✅ **should display all main UI elements**
   - Checks page title visibility
   - Verifies input field presence
   - Confirms buttons are rendered
   - Validates sections are displayed

3. ✅ **should enable create game button when name is entered**
   - Tests button disabled state initially
   - Enters player name
   - Verifies button becomes enabled
   - Confirms name was entered correctly

4. ✅ **should show no games message when no games are available**
   - Waits for games to load
   - Checks for "No games available" message

5. ✅ **should refresh games list when refresh button is clicked**
   - Clicks refresh button
   - Waits for reload
   - Verifies list is still displayed

## 🔧 Configuration

### Playwright Config (`playwright.config.ts`)
- **Test Directory**: `./e2e`
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds per test
- **Parallel Execution**: Disabled for stability (can be enabled)
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Workers**: 1 on CI, unlimited locally
- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Browser**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome profile)
- **Artifacts**: Screenshots, videos, traces on failure

### Web Server Configuration
Automatically starts before tests:
1. **Server**: `sod-server` on port 2567
2. **Client**: `sod-client` on port 3000

### CI/CD Integration
GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`):
- Runs on PRs and pushes to main
- Installs all dependencies
- Runs E2E tests
- Uploads artifacts on failure
- 15-minute timeout

## 🚀 Usage

### For Developers
```bash
# Validate setup
npm run validate:setup

# Run tests
npm run test:e2e
